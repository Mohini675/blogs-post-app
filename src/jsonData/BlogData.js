        content:"Lord Ganesha, also known as Ganpati and Vinayak, is one of the most revered and well-known deities in the Hindu dharma. He is also revered in religions such as Jainism and Buddhism.The word Ganesha is compounded from the Sanskrit word, “gana'' meaning “the host”, “multitudes” or “troops” of demigods, and “Isha” meaning “ruler”, “lord” or “sovereign”. His images, paintings and art are found throughout India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Bangladesh and in countries consisting Hindu populations. He is most distinctly recognised due to his elephant head and known also as the Elephant God, as seen through various ganpati paintings and images online.<p>Ganpati paintings have time and again illustrated the life of Lord Ganesha. These paintings originating in different art mediums such as Kalamkari, Madhubani, Tanjore etc have captured the essence of Lord Ganesha and have told stories about intellect, strength and wisdom. Before we understand who Lord Ganesha was, we need to understand his existence in this world. We all know that Lord Ganesha is the son of Shiv-Parvati and brother to Karthik. But how did he come into existence? The story of Lord Ganesh shall provide us with the answer.</p>",

        content:"There are few times where I’ve made a print and felt like my breath was truly taken away. It’s that moment where you look at the photograph that’s been spit out of the printer and you take a very deep inhale followed by a slow exhale. That’s the breath they cue you on in yoga at the start of class — and it’s what my body went into automatically when using Epson Legacy Baryta II. It’s rather fascinating as this is a breath that cues the body to let it know that it’s okay. This time around, though, my body went into this mode because of how excited I was at the print.<p>Epson says that this paper is what you’ll want to print black-and-white photos on. Specifically, it’s also designed to mimic the look of darkroom prints. That’s not the first time I’ve heard this before. Red River Palo Alto Duro Etching is another paper that was designed to do just that. But Epson specifically talks about printing black and white photos with this paper.</p><p>Epson’s Legacy paper is their highest-end stuff. That’s evident in the price — Epson Legacy Baryta II costs over $100 for 25 sheets at 17×22 inches. Then you have to have the printer and the ink. That’s starting you out at over $4 a print when you’re considering your costs. Of course, then you’ll price accordingly. Epson encourages you to print only your best work on their Legacy paper. With that said, you should be charging at least a few hundred bucks per print with this stuff.</p>",

        title:"Interior Design Elements",
        category:"Lifestyle",
        content:"The June theme on Wit & Delight is all about the art of the mix in interior design. I wanted to share more info on this topic and write about how you can apply the art of the mix in your own home.<p>When I first sat down to write this article, I thought of the book Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat (one I highly recommend!). No, this is not an interior design book, but it is a book that helps people figure out how to mix and balance different elements in the realm of cooking. I decided to take a similar approach and write about how one can mix different elements in the realm of interior design.</p><p>Today I’m sharing the three key interior design elements all of my favorite rooms have in common: color, pattern, texture, something old, and something that grounds the space. Here’s why each of these elements matters.</p><h4>3 Interior Design Elements Every Room Needs</h4><br><strong>1. COLOR</strong><p>If you’ve ever taken a painting class, you know that painters generally begin with a big field of one color on their canvas, which they then add to as they go. Consider the room you’re designing a canvas. Choose your base color first (which may be the existing color of the room or a color you plan to bring in), then consider which complementary colors you’d like to add to the mix. This article on color theory will help you begin to get a sense of how different colors play together. This article from House & Garden is also an interesting take on color rules to follow, according to interior designers.</p><strong>2. PATTERN</strong><p>Pattern adds interest, depth, and emotion to any room. Without it, a space can feel somewhat flat. Patterns can be bold or subtle, colorful or neutral, and applied broadly or selectively. From wallpaper to upholstery to rugs to decor items, there is no shortage of ways to bring pattern into a home.</p><strong>3. TEXTURE</strong><p>I LOVE adding texture to any room. Similar to rooms without pattern, rooms without a variety of textures feel somewhat dull to me. I especially like to bring in texture through fabrics (e.g., velvet, linen, wool) and materials (e.g., rattan, marble, rustic wood, metal).</p>",
